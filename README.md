# NeuralLogicGates

Purpose of this repository is to showcase implementations of logic gates using neural networks. Logic gates are basic building blocks of any digital system. And using neural networks we can simulate their behaviour.

In this repository you will find implementations of various neural networks such as AND, OR and more. These implementations demonstrate how neural networks can learn the underlying logical rules and produce accurate outputs.
